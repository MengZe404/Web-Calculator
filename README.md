> - ### Typing Input
>
>   For almost every calculator you see, there are buttons representing numbers and operators. It is good, but not perfect. Web Calculator 2.0 allows you to input any mathematical expression you want, from `1 + 1` to `f(x) = 10x^2 + 5x`, with keyboard **Only**. Now, you can speed up every calculation process without involving any clicking event!

> - ### Natural Language Processing (NLP)
>
>   What is NLP? It is an algorithm that converts natural language, such as English, to programming or in this case, mathematical language. For example,  you can input `1 plus 1 minus 2` to perform the same calculation as `1 + 1 - 2`, so you don't need to press that `shift` key anymore! Discover more by yourself!
